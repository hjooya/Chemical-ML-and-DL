### Similarity Analysis, Clustering and Visualization of Tox21 Dataset 

Toxicology in the 21st Century ([Tox21](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/tox21/index.html)) program is a collaboration between several federal agencies (NIH, FDA, EPA) to rapidly test whether substances adversely affect human health. Substances assayed in Tox21 include a diverse range of products such as: commercial chemicals, pesticides, food additives/contaminants, and medical compounds. [Tox21 dataset](https://tripod.nih.gov//tox21/pubdata/) is publically available. 

The goal of this example is to analyze the [Tanimoto similarity](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html) of the positive and negative molecules in this dataset using [RDKit](https://www.rdkit.org/), and cluster them based on their similarity. Sample molecules are visualized from the selected clusters.  

The image below shows the similarity distribution amoung the positive and negative molecules in this dataset. Noticablly, the negative molecules have higher similarities compared to the positive sub-dataset.
